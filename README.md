This respository contains files relevant to the analysis of the effect of DERs on an electricity distribution network. The hope is that the scripts included can facilitate subsequent research done using GridLAB-D. 

### The Python Scripts
There are 2 Python scripts, each one taking in a different GridLAB-D output file format (JSON or CSV). The scripts will then parse through the provided file to retrieve data relevant to the hosting capacity analysis.
